# Step 3: Review Resume

## Purpose

Evaluate each verified draft from senior hiring manager + career coach perspective.
Produce actionable ratings and improvement suggestions for refinement.

## Procedure

1. Load verified drafts from `outcome/2-verify/`, JD from `src/jd.md` or `src/jds/`

2. Grade each draft on 5 dimensions (A–D):

   **Relevance** (JD Alignment)
   A: Every major requirement addressed | D: Significant mismatch

   **Impact** (Achievement Quality)
   A: Quantified outcomes throughout | D: Generic job descriptions

   **Clarity** (Scannability)
   A: Key info visible in 6-second scan | D: Wall of text

   **Differentiation** (Uniqueness)
   A: Clear "only this person" factor | D: Entirely generic

   **ATS Readiness**
   A: High keyword match, clean format | D: Poor keywords, complex format

3. Cross-version analysis:
   - Best section overall (with justification)
   - Weakest section overall
   - Recommended base version for refinement
   - Cherry-pick list from other versions

4. Improvement suggestions — must be concrete:
   Bad: "Make it more impactful"
   Good: "Line 12: rewrite 'managed deployments' → lead with outcome"

5. Save to `outcome/3-review/review_report.md`
