# Step 0: Sync Claw-Log

## Purpose

Read daily dev records auto-generated by claw-log, compare with existing
`src/applicantinfo.md`, and merge in refined form. Never raw-copy — deduplicate,
consolidate similar entries, and add only net-new achievements.

## claw-log Output Format (Reference)

```markdown
### 📂 [project-name] - 2026-02-12
> **Key Achievement**: ...

- **🛠 Details**
  - ...

- **📝 Resume Bullet Point**
  - ...
```

## Sync Logic

### 1. Read

- Locate claw-log directory (`~/.local/share/claw-log/` or similar)
- Ask user for path on first run
- Read current `src/applicantinfo.md`

### 2. Compare & Decide

For each claw-log Resume Bullet Point, compare against applicantinfo.md:

| Situation | Verdict | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Already exists (same content) | Duplicate | Skip |
| Similar entry exists (same project/tech, further progress) | Update | Enrich existing entry |
| Completely new achievement | New | Add in refined form |

**"Similar" criteria**: Same project AND same technology/system.
Example: 3 days of TensorRT work → consolidate into one comprehensive bullet.

### 3. Refinement Rules

Never paste claw-log entries verbatim. Refine for resume readiness:

- **Consolidate duplicates**: Multiple days on same topic → one impactful statement
- **Preserve metrics**: Keep specific numbers from claw-log (latency, throughput, etc.)
- **Preserve tech keywords**: Keep framework/tool names verbatim (ATS optimization)
- **Keep concise**: 1-2 sentences per achievement max

Example:
```
Before (3 days of claw-log):
  Day 1: "Integrated TensorRT execution provider"
  Day 2: "Enabled TensorRT engine caching, set workspace to 4GB"
  Day 3: "Optimized onnxruntime SessionOptions (intra_op_threads, mem_pattern)"

After (what goes into applicantinfo.md):
  "Integrated NVIDIA TensorRT with ONNX Runtime SessionOptions optimization,
   improving real-time DL model inference (engine caching, memory tuning)"
```

### 4. Update applicantinfo.md

- **Never modify** user-written sections above the auto-collected section
- Place claw-log items under `## 📌 Auto-Collected Achievements (claw-log)` section
- Group by project, show date range
- If a project exceeds 7 entries, keep only the most impactful and consolidate the rest

### 5. Backup & Report

- Create `src/applicantinfo.md.backup` before sync
- Generate `outcome/0-sync/sync_report.md`:
  - Added items
  - Updated items
  - Skipped items (duplicates)

## Edge Cases

- claw-log not installed or no logs: skip to Step 1
- Never delete/modify user-written content
- Bulk logs (months of backlog): ask user for date range
- Target: keep applicantinfo.md under 300 lines total
