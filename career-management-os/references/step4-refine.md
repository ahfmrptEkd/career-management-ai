# Step 4: Refine Resume

## Purpose

Synthesize best elements from all verified drafts into one polished final resume,
guided by the review report.

## Procedure

1. Load verified drafts, review report, source data, and JD

2. Plan the merge using review report:
   - Base version (recommended by review)
   - Sections to cherry-pick from other versions
   - Improvement suggestions to apply

3. Build final resume:
   1. Start with base version structure
   2. Swap in cherry-picked sections (adjust transitions)
   3. Apply each improvement suggestion
   4. Unify tone across merged sections
   5. Ensure formatting consistency

4. Final quality checks:
   - Every metric traces to applicantinfo.md
   - No hallucinations reintroduced
   - Consistent tone throughout
   - Top 5 JD requirements each addressed
   - Reads well in 6-second scan
   - No orphaned references

5. Produce changelog documenting every merge decision

6. Save:
   - `outcome/4-refine/final_resume.md`
   - `outcome/4-refine/changelog.md`

## Re-run Support

If previous outputs exist: archive previous final, note changes from last version,
focus on user-flagged areas.
